Get up!
Get up!
Like this!
Just like this!
Do you feel it?
Then get up!
Just like this!
Do you wanna catch the vibe
that's keepin' me alive?
Following these fat ass beats
till I die
Fill em with tension, the sick
dimension
Rumble the earth with my
lowered suspension
Watch the ground move, let the
sound prove
That it ain't fake when the
girls get naked
Don't call it a comeback, we
bring that beat back
And we made sure that John kept
them beats phat
A lyrical rampage burnin' your
headset
Open your minds my rhymes ain't
dead yet
I want you to stand up, put
them hands up
I'll break it on down cuz
you're pumpin' my band up
Like this!
Just like this!
Come on!
Get up!
Get up, get up!
Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwin'
at me
The rhythm's so insane; it's
flowin' through your vein
Triggerin the neck poppin nerve
up in your brain
I don't even know ya, but came
to show ya
The Bizkit's Limp when the
night is over
We shake the whole place, make
this earth quake
And it aint fake when we start
the riots
So rock the bells
Psycho females doin' time
blowin' up the phone lines
Call it a stampede comin' to
your town
We aint gonna hold back; we're
comin to get down
I want you to stand up, put
them hands up
And break it on down cuz you're
pumpin' my band up
Like this!
Just like this!
Get higher!
Come on!
Get up!
Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwin'
at me
And I'll do what it takes
If I make some mistakes
It's okay cuz it's all just the
way it should be
A-break it...
Limp Bizkit's in the house,
y'all...
Limp Bizkit's in the house,
y'all...
Limp Bizkit's in the house,
y'all...
Ay-yo John... bring that beat
back!
Uh!
Just like this!
Do you feel it?
Just like this!
Yo, bring that beat back like
this!
Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwin'
at me
And I'll do what it takes
If I make some mistakes
It's okay cuz it's all just the
way it should be.
